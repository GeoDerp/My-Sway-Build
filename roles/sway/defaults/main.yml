# Lock screen wallpaper generation
# The blurred lock wallpaper is created next to the wpgtk wallpaper symlink
# (in ~/.config/wpg/wallpapers/) rather than next to the resolved real file.
# This ensures the sway config's {wallpaper}.lock.png reference works correctly
# since wpgtk substitutes {wallpaper} with the symlink path, not the resolved path.
